# mlusingpython

I thought many times it is helpful if we have this course in python

So, after completion of my course i tried to do the programming assignments in python numpy

# libraries used

1) matplotlib.pyplot for ploting the curves
 
2)scipy.optimize for advanced optimization alogorithms like newton conjugate,bfgs etc

3)numpy for calculations 

4)pandas to read the input
